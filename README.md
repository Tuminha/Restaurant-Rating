# Restaurant Rating Prediction - Regression Cumulative Project

## Project Overview

This project uses supervised machine learning models for regression to predict restaurant ratings. The goal is to build and evaluate various regression models to accurately forecast restaurant ratings based on available features such as location, cuisine type, price range, and other relevant characteristics.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- Virtual environment (already set up in `codeacademy/`)

### Installation

1. **Clone or navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/franciscoteixeirabarbosa/Dropbox/CodeAcademy/restaurant_rating
   ```

2. **Activate the virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   source codeacademy/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install additional dependencies (if needed):**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Load and explore the restaurant dataset
   - Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
   - Handle missing values and outliers

2. **Model Training:**
   - Split data into training and testing sets
   - Train multiple regression models
   - Perform hyperparameter tuning

3. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate models using cross-validation
   - Compare performance metrics
   - Select the best performing model

4. **Prediction:**
   - Make predictions on new restaurant data
   - Generate insights and recommendations

## Key Learning Objectives

- Apply regression techniques to real-world data
- Understand the importance of feature engineering
- Compare different regression algorithms
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics
- Interpret model results and make data-driven decisions

## Model Performance Metrics

The project evaluates models using:
- **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**: Measures prediction accuracy
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Average absolute difference between predicted and actual ratings
- **R-squared (RÂ²)**: Proportion of variance explained by the model
- **Cross-validation scores**: Assess model generalization
